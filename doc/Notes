Create simple visualizations
Know where to get help


Exercises and quizzes here:
All: Go here: https://git.io/r2020
1. Click binder link
2. Walkthrough: Explore RStudio
    Make new Project: workshop2020
    Look at files pane, see the .Rproj file identifying top level folder of project
    Make the following folders: data, R, output
    Copy data files from ~/data into workshop2020/data/
    Set up some defaults in the project options: 
        User-level setup: Do not save .RData when you quit R and don’t load .RData when you fire up R.
            In RStudio, this behavior can be requested in the General tab of Preferences.
            Daily work habit: Restart R very often and re-run your under-development script from the top.
            If you use RStudio, use the menu item Session > Restart R or the associated keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F10 (Windows and Linux) or Command+Shift+F10 (Mac OS). You can re-run all code up to the current line with Ctrl+Alt+B (Windows and Linux) or Command+Option+B (Mac OS).
    Run a few console commands: sessionInfo, help, example, list.files, sys.time, library(tidyverse)
    Load RDA for next few exercises    
    Pull up keyboard commands help with alt+shift+k
    Test tab completion

3. Packages
    View installed packages: pane and installed.packages()
    Install a new one with packages pane: snakecase
    Look at help for it by clicking on name
    Try to use a function from snakecase 
    Attach (check box) and try again
    Detach package (checkbox)
    Attach it again with library
    Install a new one in console: devtools 

4. Functions 1
    paste("hello", "world")
        what is separator value?
        Add "it's <YOUR FIRST NAME>" to the paste
    seq()
        1, 10
        10, 1
        1, 10, 2
        10, 1, 2
    Math operators are also functions but single symbols without parentheses:
        *
        /
        +
        Look at the available ones with ?Arithmetic
    More advanced mathematical functions have explicit functions with arguments like round(), sqrt(), and abs()
    Examples of default options with the above functions
    Calling summary on mtcars,   
    
5. Functions 2
    Attach package cranlogs
    See what :: and ::: do (note that ::: includes data as well as functions)
    Call formals on cran_downloads        
    Hit F1 on it, then F2. Does the description confirm what F2 tells you?
    Look at Help documentation

6. Objects 1
    Assignment 
        age <- Your Age (bare number in years) eg age <- 33
        first <- "YOUR FIRST NAME"
        (url <- cranlogs:::base_url) # This will show what you are saving to url
        
    Examination (print, class, str, typeof, view and click on in env pane)
        age        
        url   
    
    Look at all objects in Environment
    List all objects with ls()
    Delete the extraneous object called deleteme

    Nesting functions as objects
        round(pi, (sqrt(4)))
        Nest two paste commands to create an email address from your first name, last name, and "@mail.com":
            first paste first name and last name together with the separator "."
            next wrap that in another past command to add @mail.com   
    
7. Objects 2: Vectors
    Examine two environment vars using print, class, typeof:
        studentexp1
        studentexp2
    Apply some functions to those that work on the whole vector: length, max, sum, mean, is.na
        What happens with sum and mean when used on rexp2? Look at the help for those functions to fix it. 
        First time seeing logical values, what do they represent?
    Making Vectors with :, runif(), and c()
    Examples of coercion with c(): c(1,2,3); c(1, 2, "Three") # NULL < logical < integer < double < character
    paste() the LETTERS vector to "Sample" with sep = " " (default) first
        Now make a comma separated string of those sample names by including argument collapse=", "
    paste() the LETTERS vector to "Sample" with sep = "_"           
        Save as samples
    Use sample() to make a subset of 10 of those samples. 
    Subset out the first through 3rd elements with []

8. Dataframes and Tibbles
    Call mtcars, then as.tibble(mtcars) to see the difference
    Use View() to look at surveysheet
    Use glimpse() to look at surveysheet
    Use vis_dat() to look at surveysheet
        What datatypes do you see? (chr, numeric, date)
        What else do you see? (NA)
    Use vis_miss(x , cluster=T) to see amount missing
        How many people signed up at the survey?
        How many people signed up at registration?
        How many did both?

9. Importing data
    Import the differently named sample sheet with randomly generated scores and names
        Use vis_compare to see the differences
    Import kraken dataset
    Get remote data via URL: 

    

10. DPLYR Basics
    Create the following tibbles from surveysheet using select()
        Email and R_Experience
        First_Name Last_Name Email
    Filter using
        is.na()
        logical expressions like 
            R_Experience <= 2
            Preference == "WebEx"
            First_Name
    Arrange


11. Magrittr and DPLYR

Tidying data







XX. Script
    Transfer console work to script, 
        add comments
        add headers: explore them, alt+o/alt+shift+o


XX. More console work
    Identifying objects
    Viewing datasets
    List files in data/ex3
    Make some sequences with :, Save those to objects
    Install a package
    Look at functions in a package
        tab menu
        ls("package:visdat") 

XX. Errors, warnings etc
    Function with and without ()
    Function on wrong datatype
    library(visdat) # No quotes needed
    install.packages(visdat) # no quotes, show error
    install.packages("visdat") # installs, repeat library statement
    
XX. Use the registration data for example stuff, include RDA with the repo, load it and then go.
    mutate(First_Name = randomNames(length(First_Name), "first"), # Why doesn't this work? Think argument order
         Last_Name = randomNames(length(Last_Name), "last")) %>% 

X. Pre-break, pre-lunch: save project folder as zip
X+1. Post-break, post-lunch: upload project zip folder to continue
