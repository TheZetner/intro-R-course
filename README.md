# R Project Analysis Template
_Replace this with your actual README file_

This template is meant to guide and structure your analysis projects in R whether or not you use version control (github/gitlab). Feel free to delete the contents of this readme and fill it out again with [markdown formatted text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The folder structure helps to organize data and scripts according to their purpose and facilitate easy reuse of project workflows on new datasets. Feel free to delete every portion that doesn't fit your needs.

## Project Setup with this Template and RStudio

1. Download a zip file of the template by clicking ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheZetner/picturehosting/master/clone-or-download.png)  
2. Unzip where you want the project to live on your computer (eg. Documents/R_projects/) and rename the folder  
3. Load [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (are you not using RStudio? You really should be)  
4. Click _File>New Project...>Existing Directory_  
5. Select the unzipped template folder then _Create Project_  

Start working!

### Files in the Main Folder

* **.gitignore**: Only matters for version control. Tells Git which files it shouldn't monitor (eg. pictures, data). Has some commented lines for data and output folders that can be uncommented by the user in order to include data and output folders without their contents.    
* **01_read.R**: Set up script to read in raw data and do basic cleaning  
* **02_tidy.R**: Advanced cleaning and modification of data  
* **03_model.R**: Statistical modelling from cleaned data
* **LICENSE**: MIT open source license, default for all software projects undertaken by Bioinformatics Core  
* **README**: This file. Replace it with an explanation of your project  

### Subfolders  

* **R**: Optionally store support functions in individual R files here  
* **data**: Raw data goes here. Do not modify raw data in place. This isn't Excel.  
* **output**: Script outputs (eg. cleaned data and figures)  
* **ext**: External sources like statistical models  
* **doc**: R markdown documents explaining the analysis
